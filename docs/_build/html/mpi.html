<h1>MPI support<a class="headerlink" href="#mpi-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Nonpareil supports MPI (Message Passing Interface) since v2.2. This code is relatively stable, but
it&#8217;s not as widely tested as the regular Nonpareil.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will first need <a class="reference external" href="http://www.open-mpi.org/">OpenMPI</a> in your computer. There are other MPI implementations, but Nonpareil only supports OpenMPI (by now). Once
you have it, you should have at least the C++ compiler (typically <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpic++</span></tt>) and the interactive executable (typically <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpirun</span></tt>). If
you have the compiler in a non-standard location (for example, to coexist with mpich), change the value of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpicpp</span></tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">globals.mk</span></tt>
file. Once you are ready, simply run:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>cd nonpareil # or wherever you have the nonpareil folder
make nonpareil-mpi</pre>
</div>
<p>That&#8217;s it. Now you should have the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nonpareil-mpi</span></tt> binary, that you can place in a location listed in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$PATH</span></tt> if you want.</p>

<h2>Running Nonpareil MPI<a class="headerlink" href="#running-nonpareil-mpi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Get your machines ready. If you are familiar with MPI skip directly to #3. If you have your own infrastructure, just make sure they
are MPI-capable (network, permissions, software, etc.). If you are using a cluster, just request as many machines as you need (see
the resources section below). For example, to request 10 machines with 16 CPUs each in PBS, use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">nodes=10:ppn=16</span></tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Obtain the machine names. Just prepare a raw text file with the list of machines you want to use. If you are using PBS, you can do
this by running:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>cat $PBS_NODEFILE | awk 'NR%16==0' &gt; hosts.txt # Change the '16' by the number of CPUs you are using (the value of ppn).</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Run Nonpareil MPI. All you need is to call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nonpareil-mpi</span></tt> with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpirun</span></tt>. For example, if you want to use 10 machines, with 16
CPUs each, and the list of machines is in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hosts.txt</span></tt>, then run:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>mpirun -np 10 -machinefile hosts.txt nonpareil-mpi -t 16 -s path/to/your/sequences.fasta -b output ...</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that the options of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nonpareil-mpi</span></tt> are the exact same as for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nonpareil</span></tt>. Just remember that the value of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-t</span></tt> is the
number of threads <em>per machine</em>, not the total number of CPUs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resources">
<h2>Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you are interested on MPI, I&#8217;m assuming you have big files, so you may be also concerned about resources allocation.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>How much memory you will need?</dt>
<dd>In the <a class="reference external" href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/11/05/bioinformatics.btt584.abstract">Nonpareil paper</a> (Suppl. Fig. 6) you can see the linear relationship between maximum required RAM and the size of the
dataset. The function is approximately <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RAM</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">Size</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">2</span></tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RAM</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Size</span></tt> are both in Gb. You can use less RAM than
that, and Nonpareil will adapt, but it&#8217;ll take longer running times. This value is the &#8220;maximum required&#8221;, which means that if you
assign more RAM than that, it won&#8217;t make any difference. Now, that value is the total RAM required. That means that if you use the
MPI implementation, you can divide <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Size</span></tt> by the number of computers you are using, and then apply the function above. For example,
if you have a 50Gb dataset, you will need (maximum) 52Gb (50 + 2) of RAM for the standard implementation of Nonpareil. However, if
you use the MPI version with, for example, 10 machines, you&#8217;ll need (maximum) 7Gb (50/10 + 2) on each machine.</dd>
<dt>How many machines you will need?</dt>
<dd>I don&#8217;t have a large benchmarking yet for the MPI version, but at the end it really depends on your resources. If you have more machines,
it will run faster (unless you have a very small dataset) and it will require less memory (as discussed above).</dd>
<dt>Should I use more machines or more threads?</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Again, it depends on your resources. Multi-threading is (in general) more efficient, because it doesn&#8217;t have the overhead of network
communication. That means that you should favor more CPUs over more machines. However, there are some aspects to take into account. One,
as discussed above, is the RAM. More machines = less RAM per machine, while more threads have little impact on RAM usage (actually,
more threads = slighly more RAM). Another catch is the resources availability. It is possible that you have tens of machines for your
exclusive use, but most likely you are actually sharing resources through a cluster architecture. If you ask for 64 processors per node
(assuming you have 64-core machines) you will probably have to wait in queue for quite some time. If you ask for 4 machines, and 64
processors per node, you will likely be waiting in queue for hours or days. However, the same number of threads (256) can be gathered
by asking for 16 machines, and 16 processors per node. If you do that, you will give the scheduler more flexibility (note that the nodes=4
ppn=64 is a special case of nodes=16 and ppn=16) hence reducing your queue time. You may be asking: can I simply ask for nodes=256 and ppn=1?
Well... you can, but as I said multi-threading is more efficient than multi-nodes, so don&#8217;t go to the extremes. Also, Nonpareil has three
expensive steps:</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>Reading the fasta, which is strictly linear: only one thread is used in only one machine. This process is linear in time with the size
of the input file.</li>
<li>Comparing reads, which is threaded and multi-node. This is by far the most expensive step, and it is distributed across machines and
across CPUs on each machine. This process is linear in time with the size of the input file.</li>
<li>Subsampling, which is threaded but not multi-node. This step is not too expensive, and it&#8217;s nearly constant time. With default parameters,
it takes about 2 minutes with 64 threads, but it grows if you reduce <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-i</span></tt>. The time on this step is reduced by more threads (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-t</span></tt>), but
not by more machines.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>How can I evaluate the performance in pilot runs?</dt>
<dd>I must say: I rarely do pilot runs. However, I&#8217;m often interested on performance for future runs (for example, for other projects). There are
two sources of information that can be handy. One, is the OS itself (or the PBS output file, if you have a good Epiloge configured). For example,
to measure the total RAM used, the total walltime, real time, user time, etc. Another source is the .npl file, which contains a log of the
Nonpareil run (assuming you used the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-b</span></tt> option). The number in squared brackets is the CPU time in minutes. Note that the CPU time here is
only for the &#8220;master&#8221; machine. That means: the number of CPU minutes added for all the threads in the main machine. Another useful piece of
information is the number of &#8220;blocks&#8221; used. Ideally, you should have one block per machine; if you have more it means that the RAM assigned
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-R</span></tt>) was insufficient. You can find it right below the &#8220;Designing the blocks scheme...&#8221; line. In the ideal scenario (enough RAM), you should
have one Qry block, and as many Sbj blocks as machines (one, if you are not using the MPI implementation). If you have more than that, you could
attain shorter running times by increasing the RAM (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-R</span></tt>).</dd>
