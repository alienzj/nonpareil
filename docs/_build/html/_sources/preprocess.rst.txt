Preprocess the reads
====================

Nonpareil expects that the sequencing error is always well below 5%, so we
suggest using an expected error cutoff of 1% (*i.e.*, Q>20, or 1 error in 100
nucleotides). We recommend to perform this task using SolexaQA_.

Ideally, the reads should be in FastA format (althought Nonpareil can read
FastQ). To transform FastQ into FastA, you can simply use::

    # Input: reads.fastq
    # Output: reads.fasta
    cat reads.fastq | paste - - - - | awk 'BEGIN{FS="\t"}{print ">"substr($1,2)"\n"$2}' > reads.fasta


Also, if you have paired-end reads, you should use only one sister read per pair
in Nonpareil. If you have them interposed in the same file, you can separate
them using FastA.split.pl_::

    # Input: reads.fasta
    # Output: reads.1.fa and reads.2.fa
    FastA.split.pl reads.fasta reads 2
