Updates history
===============
What's new in 2.3
-----------------
* Updates history.
* Nonpareil R package: No changes in the functions were introduced, but they are now available
  as an R package complete with documentation. See :doc:`curves`.
* Make's ``install`` target: This includes the installation of binaries, the manual page, and the
  new Nonpareil R package.
* Simplified help: Only mandatory and commonly used arguments are now displayed with ``nonpareil -h``.
  Complete documentation is maintained both in the manual page (``man nonpareil``) and the
  `online documentation`_. In order to maintain a centralized documentation, the complete help messages
  for the Nonpareil R package are now self-contained, and were removed from the `online documentation`_.
